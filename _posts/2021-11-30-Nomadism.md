What I felt during the first week upon arrival:  
(November/December in Yucatan)

:
   It feels like the beginning of the summer. The temperature during the day will go up to 28~30C. Thanks to this warm weather, you can still find ripe fruits from a local market. 

- the high ceilings, colorful walls with tile decoration 
- old cars, beetles
- fruits: sapote (Oct, Nov), papayas, citric fruits(Nov),
- people in sombreros 
- drinks: chaya with lime, horchata, hibiscus(often called as tisana jamaica/caribbean) - often includes some sugar in it[^1].

- street food as fried plantains, fruit cocktail, tacos
- melipona(stingless bee)
