What I felt during the first week upon arrival:  
(November/December in Yucatan)

It feels like the beginning of the summer. The temperature during the day will go up to 28~30C. Thanks to this warm weather, you can still find ripe fruits from a local market. 

- the high ceilings, colorful walls with tile decoration 
- old cars, beetles
- fruits: sapote (Oct, Nov), papayas, citric fruits(Nov),
- people in sombreros 
- drinks: chaya with lime, horchata, hibiscus(often called as tisana jamaica/caribbean) - often includes some sugar in it[^1].
- street food as fried plantains, fruit cocktail, tacos
- melipona[^2]
- Some linen clothes with embroidery

[^1]: You can ask without sugar and ice by saying **"sin azucar ni hielo"**
[^2]: This stingless bee produces the organic thick honey. It might be nice to find some good quality of honey in Mexico. If you haven't seen these bees, you might think it as a fly because the size is small and they don't have stings. Please don't kill them. ;)
